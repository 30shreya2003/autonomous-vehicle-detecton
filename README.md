INTRODUCTION & PROBLEM STATEMENT
Today I'm presenting an Autonomous Target Recognition system designed for degraded environments, specifically optimized for the FLIR (Forward Looking Infrared)ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) dataset.
The Problem: Traditional object detection systems fail in challenging conditions - low light, fog, occlusions, and camouflage. For autonomous vehicles and surveillance systems, this is a critical safety issue. A pedestrian hidden by fog or a vehicle partially obscured by trees must still be detected reliably.
